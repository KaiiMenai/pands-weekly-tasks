# Programming and Scripting - Weekly Tasks

## Week 1 - Getting used to Cmder, VSCode, Python, Git, GitHub

Setting up the Got/Github link.
- Free Github account set up using ***@outlook.com
- From home directory SSH (ssh-keygen) was created for added security. The resulting ssh public key was clipped and added to the the SSH and GPG keys page within settings.
- Overall Collection file created
    - pands-course-material cloned onto local machine.
    - repositories for pands-mywork and pands-weekly-tasks created on GitHub.com, repositories cloned, configured, synchronised, and updated on local machine.
    - short python "gello world" variants created on local in VSCode and pushed up to GitHub.com.

Commands used = "git clone PASTED.URL", "git config pull.rebase false", "git pull", "git add .", "git push", "git commit -m "test"", "ls", "cd (..)", 

Order of usage in Cmder. *don't forget to commit and push in VSCode first*
 - go to file where updates were made.
 - "ls"
 - Check file is up to date with "git push"
 - "git config pull.rebase false"
 - "git add ."
 - "ls"
 - "git commit -m "updated README my work""
 - "git push"

 Probably too many steps, but checking through this list of commands/prompts helps to determine the steps needed/what is missing.
